# ðŸŒŸ 50 Mini Projects in HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript

Welcome to my collection of **50 mini web development projects**! This repository is a hands-on journey through the core front-end technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. Each project is designed to sharpen specific web development skills and encourage learning through practice.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Strengthen core HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge
- Build fully functional mini applications
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
- Practice responsive and interactive UI design
- Prepare for real-world frontend development challenges

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- HTML5 for semantic and accessible markup
- CSS3 for styling, layout, and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and logic (no frameworks or libraries)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each project is placed inside its own folder named `project1`, `project2`, ..., `project50`. Every project is self-contained with its own `index.html`, `style.css`, and optionally `script.js`.
